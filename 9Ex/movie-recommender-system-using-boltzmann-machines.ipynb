the class RBM above -**\n","\n","**1. __init__ function:**\n","* 1st we make the default `init` function each class has and pass a mandatory argument called `self`\n","* `self` corresponds to the object that will be created afterwards and we are going to define some variables and it is needed to specify that these variables are the variables of the object that will be created afterwards and not some global variables\n","* All the variables that are attached to the object, will be created by putting a `self` before the variable\n","* The next parameters in the `init` functions`nv` and `nh` are no. of visible and hidden nodes respectively\n","* Now we initialize the parameters of our future objects that will be created from this class, hence this function will initialize all the parameters we will be optimizing while training the RBM\n","* These parameters are nothing but weights and biases and are specific to RBM models and we need to specify that these variables are the variables of the object \n","* 1st comes the weight hence - `self.W`, the capital W because all the weights will be initialized in the torch tensor\n","* These weights are all the parameters of the probabilities of the visible nodes given the hidden nodes\n","* And according to theory they are initialized in a matrix of size `nh` and `nv` and this matrix will be a tensor\n","* `torch.randn(nh,nv)` will initializes a tensor of size `nh`x`nv` according to Standard Normal Distribution (mean=0 and var=1). Hence we initialized all weights for the probabilities p of the visible node according to the hidden node\n","* `self.a = torch.randn(1, nh)` will create a bias of hidden nodes and we add a fake dimension `1` for the batch coz for the fuctions in pytorch cannot expect a single input vector(1d) as an arugument but a 2d tensor where the 1st dimension represents the batch and 2nd one representing the bias\n","* Since there is 1 bias for each hidden node and we have `nh` hidden nodes and hence we created the vector of `nh` elements all initialized to some number that follows a Normal Distribution\n","* The same is created for the visible nodes using `self.b = torch.randn(1, nv)`\n","\n","**2. sample_h function:**\n","* For every hidden node in the RBM this func. will activate them according to certain probability that we compute in the same function. For each hidden node, this probabilty will be P(h|v) \n","* It is this probability that is equal to the Activation function\n","* `self` added to access variables in the __init__ function\n","* `x` corresponds to visible nodes in the probabilities P(h|v)\n","* `wx = torch.mm(x, self.W.t())` - as it is a Sigmoid activation function, we will be multiplying weights `W` with visible nodes and add bias to it and the `.t()` will create a transpose of matrix of weights to make the product consistent\n","* Now inside `activation` function, we will be adding `wx` and bias `a` \n","* And as every input vector is not treated individually but inside batches, hence we created an extra dimension earlier\n","* The bias should be applied to each line of the mini batch, i.e. each line of the dimension created above\n","* Hence we use a function `expand_as` which again adds a new dimension for this bias that we are adding and we add a parameter as (wx) to tell as what we want to expand the bias\n","* Hence inside the activation we created a linear combination of visible neurons `x` where the co-effecients are weights and to all this we add the bias\n","* `p_h_given_v` - Now we compute the activation function that will activate the hidden node and remember that this activation function represents a probability, i.e. a probability that a hidden node will be (1)activated according to the value of visible node\n","* Final step is to return the probabilities and sample of all hidden nodes according to probabilities in `p_h_given_v`\n","* `torch.bernoulli(p_h_given_v)` will give a vector of 0s(hidden nodes that weren't activated by the sampling) and 1s(hidden nodes that were activated by the sampling)\n","\n","**3. sample_v function:**\n","* Will be the same as above with slight changes\n","* `y` corresponds to hidden nodes in the probabilities P(v|h)\n","* `wy = torch.mm(y, self.W)` - here we don't take the transpose because previously we were calculating P(h|v) and since W is the matrix of P(v|h), we took the transpose.

Hence `hk` gets updated and since `vk` is the 1st sample of the visible node, the `sample_h(vk)` will return the 2nd sample of hidden node. Then this 2nd sample of hidden node will be the input of `sample_v` function and that will return the new sample of the visible nodes, i.e the 2nd sample of visible node. And again the ratings will be updated. This goes on and on as we get the 3rd sample of hidden node then the 3rd sample of visible node, etc until the end of the loop till we have 10th sample of hidden and visible node each\n","* We did this to approximate the Gradient to update the weights and bias. Coz to do that we need the last samples of hidden and visible nodes\n","* Now we don't want our model to train on the movies not rated(-1), hence we freeze the visible nodes which have a `-1` rating before training the RBM. In short, it won't be possible to update them using Gibbs sampling\n","* `vk[v0 < 0]` to get orignal(v0) ratings `-1` and we tell them to keep the `-1` ratings by `v0[v0<0]`\n","* The last essential element before applying the train function is `phk`. Hence we get it first by getting out of the for loop and applying `sample_h` function to last sample of the visible node after the 10 steps i.e. `vk`\n","* `train` doesn't return anything, it just updates the weight, hence we don't create a new variable\n","* Now training will take place, weights and biases will be updated towards the direction of maximum likelihood. The P(v|h) will be more relevant, and will get the largest weights for probabilities that are more significant. Eventually this will lead to predicted ratings being close to real ratings\n","* As we have our predictions now, we need to calculate `train_loss`\n","* `[v0 >= 0]` coz we need to consider the ratings that exist\n","* Update the counter `s` which normalizes the `train_loss` -> `(train_loss/s)`\n","* `print` function to check how we perform after every epoch and the loss associated with that respective epoch\n","\n","**Conclusions from training loss obtained - 24.64%**\n","* This loss means we will be right 3 out of 4 times while predicting\n","* In simple words we got a **76%** accuracy in predicting the ratings of movies by all our users\n","\n","\n","### Step - 12\n","* Testing the RBM\n","* We will be testing the same on new samples/observations\n","* Let's make predictions on test set without doing any training of course and we will be calcuating `test_loss`\n","* This loss would be again nothing but the mean of the absolute distances between the predictions and the actual ratings\n","* So our goal is to hope that we get a `test_loss` around `0.2464`"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["test_loss: tensor(0.2569)\n"]}],"source":["test_loss = 0                      \n","s = 0.                          \n","\n","for id_user in range(t_users):           \n","    v = train_set[id_user:id_user+1]      \n","    vt = test_set[id_user:id_user+1]      \n","    \n","    if len(vt[vt>=0]) > 0:           \n","        _,h = rbm.sample_h(v)\n","        _,v = rbm.sample_v(h)\n","        \n","        test_loss += torch.mean(torch.abs(vt[vt >= 0] - v[vt >= 0]))\n","        s += 1.\n","\n","print('test_loss: ' + str(test_loss/s) )"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**Conclusions from test loss of 25%**\n","* Here we also predict ratings correctly 3 times out of 4 or in short we get a **75%** accuracy\n","\n","**Understanding the for loop above:**\n","* We don't need a batch size here as its only specific to training \n","* `v` is input on which we will make predictions and we use `train_set` coz the input will be used to activate the hidden neurons to get the output `v`\n","* `vt` is the target and `test_set` coz we are comparing actual `test_set` results to predicted ones\n","* The `if loop` is for getting existing ratings from the target which contains orignal ratings of the test set\n","* Updating the `test_loss` and with `vt>0` we are only getting those cells which have an existing rating"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.6"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
